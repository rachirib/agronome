# Agrono.me

This app was developed in 2013 as part of a campaign on Google entrepreneurship on Latam,

Idea was to create a marketplace for small agricultural business to publish their items for sale,
At that point of time(2013) technology was not as wide as it is in 2024,

Right now, it works as a personal reference of my work years ago, but feel free to copy anything usable (if there is)

## Latest updates

Original content was not really usable to allow redeployment so a set of changes were made it "work"

- Upgraded to java 11
- Upgraded endpoints from v1 to v2
- Use maven for manage project dependencies
- Remove Eclipse configuration files
- Exclude IntelliJ configuration files

## Pending work

On 2024 there are other set of tools/frameworks that could be better suited for this use case, but for fun maybe 
some other things could be done:

- Fix Google Maps Javascript integration (Async / key )
- Separation of concerns between backend and frontend (maybe move out of AppEngine and Servlets?)
